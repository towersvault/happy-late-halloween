# Happy Late Halloween

A 3D game I worked on using LibGDX. Code is a real mess, but it basically imports tiles from a 2D Tiled map.
The game then takes these tiles and translates them into 3D objects.

Feel free to use my code (maybe leave a comment in your code thanking me :)). The art, however, is off limits.
